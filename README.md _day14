# Day 14 â€“ T Flip-Flop (Toggle Flip-Flop)

## ðŸ”Ž Introduction
The T Flip-Flop, also known as the **Toggle Flip-Flop**, is a sequential circuit that changes its output state whenever the input **T = 1** on the clockâ€™s active edge.  
- When **T = 0**, it holds the current state.  
- When **T = 1**, it toggles the output.  

It is widely used in **counters, frequency dividers, and control systems**.

```verilog
module t_ff (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input T,
    output reg Q
);

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            Q <= 0;
        else if (T)
            Q <= ~Q;
    end
