 Day 19 â€“ 4-bit Up/Down Counter
- `up_down = 1` â†’ Counter increases (0000 â†’ 0001 â†’ â€¦ â†’ 1111)  
- `up_down = 0` â†’ Counter decreases (1111 â†’ 1110 â†’ â€¦ â†’ 0000)  
ðŸ“‚ Files
- `design.sv` â€“ RTL for 4-bit up/down counter  
- `testbench.sv` â€“ Testbench with clock, reset, and control  
- `updown_counter.vcd` â€“ Waveform output  
âš¡ Simulation
1. Reset sets counter to 0  
2. Counts upward for a few cycles  
3. Switches to downward counting  
4. Switches back to upward counting  

## ðŸ“Š Waveform
The waveform clearly shows binary incrementing and decrementing sequences.
