# Day 20 – Modulo-10 (Decade) Counter

## 📘 Overview
On **Day 20**, I designed a **Modulo-10 counter (Decade Counter)** in Verilog.  
This counter counts from **0 → 9** and then resets back to 0, repeating the cycle.  

It is commonly used in:
- Digital clocks (0–9 digits for seconds, minutes)
- Timers
- Frequency dividers

## 📂 Files
- `design.sv` – RTL for Mod-10 counter  
- `testbench.sv` – Testbench with clock & reset  
- `mod10_counter.vcd` – Waveform output  

## ⚡ Simulation
1. Reset applied at the start  
2. Counter increments from 0 to 9  
3. Rolls back to 0 and continues  

## 📊 Waveform
- Shows counting sequence 0000 → 0001 → … → 1001 → 0000  
- Repeats cyclically
