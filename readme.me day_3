 Day 3 - 2-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX) in Verilog

Project Overview
A Multiplexer (MUX)is a combinational circuit that selects one input out of multiple available inputs based on the select line.

In this project, we implement a 2-to-1 MUX in Verilog and verify its functionality using a testbench and waveform simulation.
