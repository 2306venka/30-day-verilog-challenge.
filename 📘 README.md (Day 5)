Day 5 - 4-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX)

A Multiplexer (MUX) is a combinational circuit that selects one input from multiple inputs and forwards it to a single output.  
Here, we implement a 4-to-1 MUX in Verilog.

- Inputs: 4 data inputs (`d[3:0]`), 2-bit select (`sel`)  
- Output: Single output (`y`)  

 📝 Verilog Code
Implemented using conditional (ternary) operators.

🧪 Testbench
The testbench checks the output for all select line combinations.

 📊 Waveform
- When `sel = 00`, output = `d[0]`  
- When `sel = 01`, output = `d[1]`  
- When `sel = 10`, output = `d[2]`  
- When `sel = 11`, output = `d[3]`  

#🚀 Learning Outcome
- Understood how multiplexers are implemented in Verilog.  
- Learned to use **conditional operators** for logic selection.
