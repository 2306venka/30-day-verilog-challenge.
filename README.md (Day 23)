# Day 23 – 4-bit Serial-In Parallel-Out (SIPO) Shift Register

## 📘 Overview
On **Day 23**, I built a **4-bit SIPO shift register** in Verilog.  
Unlike SISO, where only the final bit is visible, here all **4 bits** shifted in can be observed simultaneously as parallel output.

- Input bits enter one by one serially  
- After each clock, outputs update in parallel  
- Very useful in **UART receivers and data converters**  

## 📂 Files
- `design.sv` – RTL for SIPO shift register  
- `testbench.sv` – Testbench with serial input pattern  
- `sipo_shift_register.vcd` – Waveform output  

## ⚡ Simulation
1. Reset clears the register  
2. Sequence `1011` is shifted in  
3. After 4 clocks → parallel_out = `1011`  

## 📊 Waveform
- Shows gradual filling of parallel_out with each clock  
- Parallel_out makes it easy to see the full data word
