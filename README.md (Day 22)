Day 22 â€“ 4-bit Serial-In Serial-Out (SISO) Shift Register
On Day 22, I designed a **4-bit SISO shift register** in Verilog.  
It shifts data bit-by-bit from input to output on each clock cycle.

- New bit enters at LSB (shift_reg[0])  
- Existing bits shift left  
- Oldest bit appears at the output  

ðŸ“‚ Files
- `design.sv` â€“ RTL for 4-bit SISO shift register  
- `testbench.sv` â€“ Testbench with serial input sequence  
- `siso_shift_register.vcd` â€“ Waveform output  

âš¡ Simulation
1. Reset clears the register  
2. Serial input `1011` is shifted in  
3. After 4 clocks, the sequence appears at the output  

ðŸ“Š Waveform
- Shows bits moving through each stage of the register  
- Final serial_out gives the oldest bit in the sequence
