Day 6 - 1-to-4 Demultiplexer (DEMUX)

On Day 6 of my 30 Days of Verilog Challenge, I implemented a 1-to-4 Demultiplexer.  
A DEMUX takes a single input and channels it to exactly one of the multiple outputs, based on the select lines.
- Input:`din` (data input)
- Select Lines: `sel[1:0]` (2-bit control)
- Outputs: `y0, y1, y2, y3`

Files
- `demux1to4.v` → Verilog implementation of 1:4 DEMUX  
- `tb_demux1to4.v` → Testbench for simulation and waveform analysis  

🖥️ Simulation
- Tool Used: [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/)  
- Simulator: Icarus Verilog + EPWave for waveform visualization  
📊 Waveform
The waveform shows how the input is routed:
- `sel = 00` → Output = `y0`  
- `sel = 01` → Output = `y1`  
- `sel = 10` → Output = `y2`  
- `sel = 11` → Output = `y3`
