# Day 13 - JK Flip-Flop (Positive Edge Triggered)
A JK Flip-Flop is a universal sequential element that can perform the operations of **SR, D, and T flip-flops**.  
- `J=0, K=0` → No change  
- `J=0, K=1` → Reset  
- `J=1, K=0` → Set  
- `J=1, K=1` → Toggle  

 Files
- `jk_ff.v` → Design file
- `tb_jk_ff.v` → Testbench

▶️ Simulation
- Simulator: Icarus Verilog (via EDA Playground)
- Waveforms generated using `$dumpfile` & `$dumpvars`
 📊 Output
The waveform shows:
- **Set, Reset, Toggle operations** of JK Flip-Flop  
- Proper synchronous behavior with clock
