# Day 15 â€“ Master-Slave JK Flip-Flop

## ðŸ”Ž Introduction
The **Master-Slave JK Flip-Flop** is a sequential circuit designed to eliminate the **race-around problem** found in JK Flip-Flops.  
It uses two latches:
- **Master latch** â†’ active on the positive edge of the clock.
- **Slave latch** â†’ active on the negative edge of the clock.

Thus, the output changes only once per clock cycle.
