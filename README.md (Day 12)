Day 12: SR Latch (NOR-based)
An **SR Latch** is a basic sequential circuit built using two **NOR gates** with feedback.  
It stores **1-bit of data** and is considered one of the fundamental building blocks of memory.

- **S (Set):** Sets output Q = 1  
- **R (Reset):** Resets output Q = 0  
- **Hold:** When S = 0 and R = 0, latch holds its previous state  
- **Invalid:** When S = 1 and R = 1 simultaneously â†’ invalid condition

Expected Waveform
- Q = 1 when **Set**  
- Q = 0 when **Reset**  
- Holds previous value when **S=0, R=0**  
- Invalid when **S=1, R=1**
