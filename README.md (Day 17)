## 📌 Project: 4-bit Synchronous Counter

### 🔹 Description
A **synchronous counter** is a digital circuit where all flip-flops are triggered by the same clock signal.  
In this project, I implemented a **4-bit up counter** that increments on each positive clock edge.

### 🔹 Features
- 4-bit counter (counts from 0 to 15)
- Synchronous reset
- Increments on each clock pulse

### 🔹 Waveform
The waveform shows the counter incrementing values `0000 → 1111`.

### 🔹 Applications
- Digital clocks ⏰
- Event counters
- Frequency dividers
