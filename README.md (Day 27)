# Day 27 - FIFO (First In First Out Memory)
In this project, I implemented a synchronous FIFO (First In First Out)** memory buffer using Verilog.  
FIFO is commonly used in digital systems for **data buffering** (e.g., UART, networking, pipelines).

- **Depth**: 4  
- **Width**: 8 bits  
- **Operations**: Write, Read  
- **Status Flags**: `full`, `empty`

 ðŸ“Š Simulation
- Writes three values into FIFO  
- Reads two values  
- Writes one more value  
- Reads remaining values  
 Tools Used
- **EDA Playground**  
- **Icarus Verilog**  
- **EPWave for waveform**
