# Day 1 – Basic Gates (Verilog)

This project demonstrates the implementation of basic logic gates in Verilog.  
The following gates are covered:
- AND
- OR
- NOT
- NAND
- NOR
- XOR
- XNOR
Files
- gates.v – Verilog code for basic gates.
-tb_gates.v – Testbench to verify the design.

Expected Output
- The truth tables of all basic gates will be verified using the testbench.
- Simulation done using [EDA Playground]
Truth Table Example (AND Gate)
| A | B | Y |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

Day 1 Goal: 
Understand how to write Verilog modules for basic gates and verify them using a testbench.
Simulation done using EDA Playground
